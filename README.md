# Postfix to HTTP

This is a proof-of-concept. The server can accept Postfix sockmap requests. The requests are converted to HTTP requests via a configuration. The server then executes the request and returns a suitable result to Postfix.

This implementation is still completely untested!

The unit test is also still faulty.

It is still in the middle of development.
